# streaming_v2.0
Streaming project V2.0
<h4>
⚠ Just a college project still working on it.
the code is so messed up and has poor front-end design. ⚠
</h4>
<hr><br>
the project is a YouTube-like platform. with the help of FFmpeg on python flask, it can convert any video format file into hls format for able to streaming through HTTP easily.
in final it'll be deployed on the container to make it easy to use and install.
